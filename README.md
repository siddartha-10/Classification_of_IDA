## About The Project


Our project aims to use Machine Learning to help doctors identify a type of anemia called Iron deficiency anemia  (IDA). IDA diagnosis requires both complete blood count (CBC) and serum ferritin tests. In the current model we used blood cell features (count and morphology) to identify IDA with out the need for addition serum ferritin test, thus saving the cost. Our method works well on different sets of data. Below are the steps to try our application.
